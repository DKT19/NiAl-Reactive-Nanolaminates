# NiAl-Reactive-Nanolaminates
Automated creation of temperature profiles and velocity calculations for Ni/Al reactive nanolaminate combustion reaction.

Polynomial fit to check for inflection points when temperature profile not fully developed.
Exponential decay fit with velocity calculations at multiple temperatures to check velocity.
