# NiAl-Reactive-Nanolaminates
Automated creation of temperature profiles and velocity calculations for Ni/Al reactive nanolaminate combustion reaction.

Polynomial fit to check for inflection points when temperature profile not fully developed.  
Exponential decay fit with velocity calculations at multiple temperatures to check velocity.  
Currently all posted simulations have a 1:1 atomic ratio
